GOLF COURSE SERVICE / URBANA COUNTRY CLUB<br>
May 2019 – October 2023<br>
    I started doing outdoor services cleaning golf carts and picking the driving range. As I became more established at the club I worked in and around the pro shop and I built great relationships with members since I had been there for quite a while considering it was a part time college job. In my last 2 years I spent at the club I trained new employees and even showed my superiors how we operate.<br> </p>
